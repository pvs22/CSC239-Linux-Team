There is a msserver.cpp which creates a server and listens for web server client and sends commands to the agents.  Once it detects a connection from the web server, it creates the appropriate # of threads and tries to get the data from the agents.
mstestclient.cpp is a test web client.

To test the program open three terminals and do the following commands in the below order:
terminal1: run "./agent" to start the agent for collecting the performance data. 
terminal2: run "./server 3000" to start the management
terminal3: run "./testclient localhost 3000"


In terminal2 the server process should print: 
Message from client: ws msg 
Reading perf_stats
Platform Id:L
Name:agent1
