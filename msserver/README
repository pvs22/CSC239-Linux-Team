There is a msserver.cpp which would create a server and listen for web server.  Once it detects a connection from the web server, it would create appropriate # of threads and try to get information from all the servers.
mstestclient.cpp is just a test file to test out the server.

Usage: server 3000
Usage: client localhost 3000 "This message will be sent to the server"
